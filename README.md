# ddbcalc

[![Go Coverage](https://github.com/ryeguard/ddbcalc/wiki/coverage.svg)](https://raw.githack.com/wiki/ryeguard/ddbcalc/coverage.html)

A DynamoDB item size calculator.

This package has no dependencies other than AWS's [aws-sdk-go-v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2).

## Raison d'Ãªtre

DynamoDB has a limit of 400KB for the size of an item. The `ddbcalc` package provides functionality to calculate the size of any Go struct in bytes. This can be useful when you need to ensure that the size of an item does not exceed the limit, either through tests or at runtime.

For more info, please see the blog post at [rygard.se](https://www.rygard.se/blog/240220_dynamodb_item_size/240220_dynamodb_item_size.html).

## Usage

### CLI

The `ddbcalc` command-line tool can be used to calculate the size of a json file from the terminal.

Install the tool with the following command:

```sh
go install github.com/ryeguard/ddbcalc/cmd/ddbcalc@latest
```

You can then run the tool with the following command:

```sh
ddbcalc -file path/to/file.json
```

### Package

By importing `github.com/ryeguard/ddbcalc`, you can use the modules's exported functions in your Go code.

For example, the `StructSizeInBytes` function calculates the size of a struct in bytes. It may be used as follows:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ryeguard/ddbcalc"
)

type Item struct {
	ID    string
	Name  string
	Age   int
	Email string
}

func main() {
	item := Item{
		ID:    "123",
		Name:  "John Doe",
		Age:   30,
		Email: "john@example.com",
	}

	size, err := ddbcalc.StructSizeInBytes(item)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("Item size: %d bytes\n", size)
}
```

You can run the example above with the following command:

```sh
go run example/basic/main.go
```

For more examples, see the [examples](./examples) directory and also check out the tests in any [`*_test.go`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aryeguard%2Fddbcalc+path%3A*_test.go&type=code) files.
